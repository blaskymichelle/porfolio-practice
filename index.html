			<h2>About Us</h2><br>
			<p> I started this business because I was tired of not feeling connected to every website I was going in, I believed there had to be a better way. We are all different in many ways, but our eyes are attracted to specific bits and pieces in web designs. Have you ever had an ‘a-ha’ moment where you realize something great can come from this? That’s how my company began, with that simple moment.We’re looking forward to opening more technological branches, where we can make what you desire!.</p>
